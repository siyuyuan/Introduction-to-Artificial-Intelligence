Adapted from the Berkeley Pac-Man Assignments originally created by John DeNero and Dan Klein.  

In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, 
both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. 
You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios. 
The code for this project consists of several Python files, 
some of which you will need to read and understand in order to complete the assignment, and some of which you can ignore.
